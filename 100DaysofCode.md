### Coursera: Getting Started with Go
Time estimate: TBD.

Overall Impression: Good for intermediate programmers. I'm enjoying it so far.

### CodeAcademy: Learn Go
Time estimate: 5-6 hours. Less if you're not distracted. [link](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-go)

Overall Impression: Beginner-friendly. For me, it was a bit slow as I was using it as a refresher on syntax and other items and may have underestimated myself.

I'd say this course is good for someone with little-to-no programming experience, or someone who is transitioning from procedural programming to OOP. I would not recommend it for someone with OOP experience.
