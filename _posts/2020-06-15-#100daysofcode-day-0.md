title: "#100DaysofCode: Day0: Time to level up my Go"
---

I've decided to give [#100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) a try to level up  my Go skills a bit. Currently, my Go usage is largely linked to work & primarily with functional testing through the usage of [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest). I've got a rudimentary todo app and [introductory Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started) in a half-assed state of completion. Time to change this!

I've chosen Go due to its versatility with my job, footprint in the SRE world, and because it's been the most intriguing language for me to work with thus far from a reliability perspective. It is damn fast and has less dependencies than Python. I can't even get mad at it when it complains to me about things such as declared and unused variables, since it forces me to clean up my code.

Current plan of attack:

* Steal the log format from this guy's Github: [#100DaysofCode log](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) and start posting my progress here.
* Start from the ground up to get myself back on track a bit. Starting with [CodeAcademy's Learn Go course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-go) which I should get through in no short order since I work with functions in Go at work and this is a beginner course.
* Jump back into the [introductory Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started) in order to pick up where I left off.

If I get through these, I'll get to the meatier, super cool Coursera courses which I really, really want to work on:

[Functions, Methods, and Interfaces in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-functions-methods)

[Concurrency in Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-concurrency)
