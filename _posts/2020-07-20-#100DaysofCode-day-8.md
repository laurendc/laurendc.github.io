title: "#100DaysofCode - Day8: We're now working through HTML and CSS"
---

Today's Progress: Welp, took another break. I apparently get bored easily. Decided to brush off my HTML and CSS bits. It's been a while, and I'm having flashbacks to my LiveJournal days. /sigh

Thoughts: Not a bad departure. But thinking to getting back to HackerRack, where I was progressing on Python questions.

Link to work: N/A, as I'm going through Udacity.
