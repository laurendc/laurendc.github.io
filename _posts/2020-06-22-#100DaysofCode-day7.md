title: "#100DaysofCode - Day7: Got bored with Coursera. Working through HackerRank." 
---

Today's Progress: I took a break. I have the attention span of a gnat & got bored. I started about 2 other things. Then signed up for HackerRank and worked on a couple of challenges from it. Going through the Python and Shell problems.

Thoughts: Fun. But alas, my attention span doesn't want to keep going with Go anymore.
