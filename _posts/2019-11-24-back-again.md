title: "2019 Reflection: There and Back Again"

Starting this blog off by reflecting a bit on 2019.

In the beginning of the year, I did find myself in quite a hopeful position at `$LastCompany`. We were roughly halfway through a major cloud migration. As the main engineer leading the initiative, I was shocking optimistic about our timelines.  Loved who I worked with; loved my boss. Work life was good.  I do find myself missing this place from time to time.

In the middle of the year, I found myself starting a new job.  I had, after quite a bit of coaxing, been convinced by a former colleague and friend to apply for a gig at `$CurrentCompany`.  I was quite nervous about this job as I wasn't quite sure what to expect or if I was qualified. One thing that a mentor at my new job told me recently is that if I didn't feel a bit scared, that it meant that I wasn't being challenged and that the job may not be right for me. 

I've found that as the year ends that I am thinking of this statement more and what it has meant for me winding down the year at `$CurrentCompany`. I have found that after my third month in that the nervousness that I've felt has started to subside.  While the fear hasn't totally gone away, I do find that I'm a great place for 2020 at this place.

I think that I'll always need a little bit of fear to do my best work.
