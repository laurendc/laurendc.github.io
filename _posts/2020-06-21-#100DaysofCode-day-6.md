Today's Progress: Picked back up where I left off in [Cousera's Getting Started with Go](https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-getting-started/). Pointers, garbage collection, control flow, Scan.

Thoughts: Looking forward to this. Enjoyed learning about how Go handles garbage collection.

Link to work: N/A as I just went through the lecture for Week 2. I'll probably have something tomorrow.
